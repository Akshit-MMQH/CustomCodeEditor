This project is a React-based code builder that utilizes the Monaco Editor. It allows users to write and execute code snippets within a web browser. It uses Judge0 as a code execution system

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine
npm or yarn package manager

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

Install dependencies using npm or yarn:
bash
```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project if it doesn't already exist.
Set the JUDGE0_SUBMISSION_URL environment variable in the .env file. This variable should point to the URL of the Judge0 API endpoint you want to use for code execution. For example:
plaintext

```
JUDGE0_SUBMISSION_URL=https://api.judge0.com/submissions
```

Replace https://api.judge0.com/submissions with the appropriate URL for your Judge0 API endpoint.

Running the Development Server
Once the configuration is complete, you can start the development server to see the React code builder in action.

```
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

## Usage
